# Building web applications in Java with Spring Boot 3 - Tutorial
## What is the best way to build a Spring project?
The best way to create a Spring project is with the <font color="#6db33f">spring</font> initializr which is found at.

## What is the project type? What is the build tool?
Examples: Gradle-Groovy, Gradle-Kotlin, Maven

## Project Metadata
Spring projects have a Group name, an artifact, and a name.

The reverse domain name is typically used.

Example: danvega.dev -> dev.danvega

For this project, the Group will be dev.danvega, the artifact will be runnerz, and the name will be runnerz.  The package name will therefore be dev.danvega.runnerz.

A <font color="#ff9d00">groupId</font> indicates the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project. The groupId is one of the key identifiers of a project and is typically based on the fully qualified domain name of your organization. For example org.apache.maven.plugins is the designated groupId for all Maven plugins.

An <font color="#1099ff">artifactId</font> indicates the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project. The primary artifact for a project is typically a JAR file. Secondary artifacts like source bundles also use the artifactId as part of their final name. A typical artifact produced by Maven would have the form artifactId-version.extension (for example, myapp-1.0.jar).

A <font color="#ff55aa">name</font> indicates the display name used for the project. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation.

## Action Item 1a
Start a spring project with the <font></font> initializr, with the following criteria:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Project type set to: <strong>Maven</strong></li>
        <li>Language type set to: <strong>Java</strong></li>
        <li>Spring Boot version set to: <strong>3.2.3</strong></li>
        <li>Group set to: <strong>dev.danvega</strong></li>
        <li>Artifact set to: <strong>runnerz</strong></li>
        <li>Name set to: <strong>runnerz</strong></li>
        <li>Packaging set to: <strong>Jar</strong>
        <li>Java version set to: <strong>21</strong> (or 24 or 25)
        <li>Dependencies set to: Spring Web and Spring Boot DevTools
    </ol>

## Module 2: Create your Project
What is a component?

A class marked with the<font color="#ff9d00">@Component</font> annotation essentially says that this class is available to Spring.  Spring is an inversion-of-control framework, and we flip the onus on Spring to handle classes for us - using the **new** keyword isn't ideal - instead, we can use @Component to tell Spring to use that particular component.  However, Spring won't know about components outside of the default (outside of main) class, which in this case is **dev.danvega.runnerz**.  Creating a class (e.g. WelcomeMessage) in a package, like **foo.bar** in the **java** directory will not enable Spring to use this component.  One workaround is to put this in the default.

## What is the application context?
The Spring Application Context is a huge container of all the classes in your application, and we can ask the application context for a particular class, (e.g. WelcomeMessage). The Spring Application Context can be used to get a particular bean by its name (e.g. welcomeMessage). A **bean** is nothing more than an instance of a class with some metadata around it that the Spring Application Context is managing for me. However, this code will only work if the class is within the main package, which in this case is **dev.danvega.runnerz**.

```java
ConfigurableApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
WelcomeMessage welcomeMessage = (WelcomeMessage) context.getBean("welcomeMessage");
```

### Tip #1
When writing code, always make sure it is within the main package of the project. Don't put it outside of the main package or in the default package; because when getting into using Spring's dependency injection and inversion of control, it's not going to work.

## Going over the console
Logging is configured by Spring out of the box.  SLF4j (Simple Logging Facade For Java) is the default logger in Spring Boot.  The default levels in SLF4J are all, debug, error, fatal, info, off, and trace: https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/apache/log4j/Level.html. To configure them differently than their defaults, there is Spring documentation can be referred to for that here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/logging.html#features.logging.log-levels.

Currently, there is no active profile set.  The Devtools are on and enables automatic application restarts and sets sensible defaults, like showing the console for an in-memory H2 database.

## Action Item 2a - After this tutorial, build a weight-lifting API!

## Two popular ways of structuring code are Package by Layer and Package by Feature

### Package by Layer:

In an MVC app, there are controllers, models, services, configurations, repositories, etc.  These are different layers of an application.  The problem with this is type of configuration would have to talk to a controller or service outside of this package, so both the controller and the service would need to be public.

Package by Feature:
Everything related to a particular feature is in this package. For example, everything related to a "run" is in a "run" package, and everything related to a "user" is in a "user" package.  These packages can live in the Java world where everything by default is packaged private.
