# Building web applications in Java with Spring Boot 3 - Tutorial
## What is the best way to build a Spring project?
The best way to create a Spring project is with the <font color="#6db33f">spring</font> initializr which is found at.

## What is the project type? What is the build tool?
Examples: Gradle-Groovy, Gradle-Kotlin, Maven

## Project Metadata
Spring projects have a Group name, an artifact, and a name.

The reverse domain name is typically used.

Example: danvega.dev -> dev.danvega

For this project, the Group will be dev.danvega, the artifact will be runnerz, and the name will be runnerz.  The package name will therefore be dev.danvega.runnerz.

A <font color="#ff9d00">groupId</font> indicates the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project. The groupId is one of the key identifiers of a project and is typically based on the fully qualified domain name of your organization. For example org.apache.maven.plugins is the designated groupId for all Maven plugins.

An <font color="#1099ff">artifactId</font> indicates the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project. The primary artifact for a project is typically a JAR file. Secondary artifacts like source bundles also use the artifactId as part of their final name. A typical artifact produced by Maven would have the form artifactId-version.extension (for example, myapp-1.0.jar).

A <font color="#ff55aa">name</font> indicates the display name used for the project. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation.

## Action Item 1a
Start a spring project with the <font></font> initializr, with the following criteria:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Project type set to: <strong>Maven</strong></li>
        <li>Language type set to: <strong>Java</strong></li>
        <li>Spring Boot version set to: <strong>3.2.3</strong></li>
        <li>Group set to: <strong>dev.danvega</strong></li>
        <li>Artifact set to: <strong>runnerz</strong></li>
        <li>Name set to: <strong>runnerz</strong></li>
        <li>Packaging set to: <strong>Jar</strong>
        <li>Java version set to: <strong>21</strong> (or 24 or 25)
        <li>Dependencies set to: Spring Web and Spring Boot DevTools
    </ol>

## Action Item 2a

## Module 2: Create your Project
What is a component?

A class marked with the<font color="#ff9d00">@Component</font> annotation essentially says that this class is available to Spring.  Spring is an inversion-of-control framework, and we flip the onus on Spring to handle classes for us - using the **new** keyword isn't ideal - instead, we can use @Component to tell Spring to use that particular component.  However, Spring won't know about components outside of the default (outside of main) class, which in this case is **dev.danvega.runnerz**.  Creating a class (e.g. WelcomeMessage) in a package, like **foo.bar** in the **java** directory will not enable Spring to use this component.  One workaround is to put this in the default.

## What is the application context?
The Spring Application Context is a huge container of all the classes in your application, and we can ask the application context for a particular class, (e.g. WelcomeMessage).
